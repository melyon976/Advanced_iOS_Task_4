Remora is an assistive mobile application designed to improve the quality of life for individuals living with dementia, while providing essential tools for carers and healthcare professionals. We emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and safety, combining personalized care features with cloud features. We wan to help patients maintain independence, routine, and emotional stability while keeping carers informed and engaged.

Remora has a clear, calming, and user-friendly interface tailored for elderly users. Large icons, intuitive navigation, and high-contrast text make interaction simple and non-intimidating. The consistent blue and white color scheme reinforces a sense of calmness and trust — an important psychological factor in dementia care. Accessibility features such as voice commands, text-to-speech, and a persistent home button improve usability for patients experiencing memory lapses or motor difficulties. Feedback from test users suggests that the interface feels welcoming and easy to understand, even for those with limited technological experience.

Our app performs well across its core features:
Reminders and Notifications reliably alert users for medications, appointments, and meals, reducing dependency on external reminders.
Memory Journal functions as a digital diary, allowing photo, text, and audio entries, fostering a sense of personal continuity and reflection.
Carer and Doctor Portals enable synchronization of information through Firestore, ensuring up-to-date data for all involved.
Location Tracking works effectively using Core Location services, providing real-time safety alerts in case of wandering incidents.

The app’s integration of cognitive health features — such as memory games and emotional journaling — sets it apart from conventional reminder apps. It merges emotional support with practical management, addressing both psychological and safety needs.  By enabling carers and medical professionals to collaborate through a shared data model, the app promotes a connected care ecosystem, reflecting modern healthcare practices that emphasize remote monitoring and patient empowerment.
